You can get the latest versions ("Dev versions") of AuthMe from Jenkins:

- [AuthMeReloaded Dev Jenkins](http://ci.xephi.fr/job/AuthMeReloaded/) â€“ run after every change

#### How to find the downloads
The panel "Build history" on the left shows the latest _builds_; if there is a blue circle next to the number, it means that the code could be successfully converted to a .jar file that you can use for your server.

Clicking on the build number will allow you to download the JAR file that was generated, allowing you to take the latest changes (e.g. Click on #347 and download the appropriate .jar file under "Build artifacts").

Remember: the Jenkins runs after _every_ change, which means it may fix recent bugs but it may introduce new issues as well.
