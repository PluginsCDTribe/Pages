AuthMe supports different types of registration. You can configure the type of registration by changing the `type` setting under `registration` in your config.yml.

## Password Registration
The default registration: the user provides the password he wants to use to `/register`. The account is registered with the given password.

You can disable passwords from being used in `unsafePasswords` and length restrictions can be configured with `minPasswordLength` and `passwordMaxLength` in config.yml.

**Example:**
> Player "Bobby" uses `/register s3cret s3cret` -> AuthMe registers "Bobby" with password "s3cret"

## Email Registration
The user provides his email address to `/register`. AuthMe will generate a password for the account and email it to the given email address.

## Two Factor Registration
:warning: **Work in progress** -- allows users to register with an authenticator app, i.e. each time they log in they have to enter a number generated by the app.
